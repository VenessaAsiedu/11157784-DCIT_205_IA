          Welcome
          </h2>
            <p>
            We are in the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer Science. The study of computer science is therefore critical and much need if society is to take full advantage of the benefits Information Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances. <br>Computer science involves the study and development of applications that allow for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that support these applications, and the means and methods used to produce both applications and systems that behave reliably, correctly and ethically.<br>
            The range of courses available in the department and the skills acquired by students enable them to find employment in many diverse fields of the economy and prepare our graduates for the computing industry, working in a project team (or research and development team), and to enable the graduate to bring specialist skills to that team.<br>
            The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major and Major-Minor  as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
